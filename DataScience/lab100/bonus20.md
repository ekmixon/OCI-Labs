# LAB 100-20: Predict housemarket sales price using Oracle AutoML

![Workshop Data Science](../commonimages/workshop_logo.png)

In LAB100, we shown how to predict a house sale price through regression. We applied a various data science techniques to explore the modify the data in a way that would allow us to build a good predictive regression model. In this lab we will explore how to utilize the Oracle Accelerated Data Science Library (ADS) and the Oracle AutoML library to speed up and simply the same work.

This lab will start from scratch, you don't need to complete previous labs to proceed but it would be a beneficial to complete LAB100 first, to be able to compare the difference in functionalities.

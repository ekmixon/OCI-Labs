# WebLogic for OCI - non JRF



## Objective

This Hands on Lab will go through the process of creating a non JRF type of WebLogic for OCI Instance - using Oracle Cloud Marketplace - and through the steps of deploying a simple application.



## Step 1. Create WebLogic for OCI Stack

- After logging in, go to Hamburger Menu, *Solutions and Platform* -> *Marketplace*:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image040.png)



- You can choose to browser-search for *WebLogic Server*, or you can apply the filters:
  - **Type**: *Stack*
  - **Publisher**: *Oracle*
  - **Category**: *Application Development*

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image050.png)



- Choose *WebLogic Server Enterprise Edition UCM*; This brings you to the Stack Overview page:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image060.png)



- Make sure *CTDOKE* compartment is selected and to accept *Oracle Terms of Use*:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image070.png)



- Fill in Stack information:
  - **Name**: *WLSNN* - where **NN** is your unique suffix given by the instructor
  - **Description**: Any meaningful description, maybe type in your name/initials
- Click **Next**

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image090.png)



- Start to fill in details:

  - **Resource Name Prefix**: *WLSNN* - where **NN** your unique suffix
  
  - **WebLogic Server Shape**: *VM.Standard2.1*
  
  - **SSH Public Key**: copy and paste the content from the provided **weblogic_ssh_key.pub** file; it contains the public key in RSA format; be sure to include the whole content in one line, including *ssh-rsa* part at the beginning.
  
    - Note: if you have used the Cloud Shell to generate the weblogic ssh key, you can use the `cat` command to display its contents:
  
      ```
      cat weblogic_ssh_key.pub
      ```

    - On Windows, use `Ctrl+INSERT` to copy the highlighted aria as in the above example.
  
    - On Mac, you can simply use `command+c`

- Continue setting up:

  - **WebLogic Server Node count**: *2* (we will create a WebLogic cluster with two nodes / managed servers)
  
  - **Admin user name**: *weblogic*
  
  - **Secrets OCID for WebLogic Server Admin Password**: 
  
    - Enter the OCID of the Secret that was set up earlier for this.  If you if you are using the CTD (Cloud Test Drive) environment, this OCID might be in a document provided by your instructor.
      - A bit of context: the WebLogic Server Admin Password it's stored in an OCI Vault as an OCI Secret (encrypted with an OCI Encryption Key); during WebLogic Domain creation, the provisioning scripts will setup the admin password by getting it from the OCI Secret instead of having it as a Terraform variable; in a similar way - if talking about an JRF enabled domains - the database admin password will be referred from an OCI Secret

- Don't change WebLogic Server Advanced Configuration

- Choose the same *CTDOKE* Compartment

- WebLogic Server Network parameters:

  - Choose **Create New VCN**

    ![](images/wlsvcn1.png)

  - For the Subnet Strategy:

    - Create New Subnet
    - Use Public Subnet
    - Regional Subnet

    ![](images/wlsvcn2.png)

  - Tick to **Provision Load Balancer**

    - **Load Balancer Shape**: *100Mbps*

    ![](images/wlsvcn3.png)





- Leave Identity Cloud Service Integration **unchecked** as default (no integration) 
- Leave **OCI Policies** checked, as a Dynamic Group containing the WebLogic Compute nodes will be created automatically alongside policies for letting them access the Secrets from Vault

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image153.png)


- Leave **Provision with JRF** unchecked, as we will not associate this WLS instance with a database
- Leave **Configure Application Datasource** also unchecked, as we will not use application datasources

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image155.png)


- Review the Stack configuration and Click **Create**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image170.png)



- A Stack Job is being kicked off and our WebLogic Domain starts to be provisioned. Console context moves to Stack's details page (*Solutions and Platform* > *Resource Manager* > *Stacks*):

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image180.png)



- While all resources being created we can check the Job Logs; it helps fixing potentially configuration errors if the provisioning fails:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image190.png)



- After approx. 15 minutes, the Job should complete with success:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image200.png)



- We can check the *Outputs* section of Job Resources and check for two important values:
  - Sample Application URL (we can can try it at this moment, but the out of the box sample application won't load as we need to finish the SSL configuration of the Load Balancer)
  - WebLogic Server Administration Console

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image210.png)



- Let's check the **WLS admin console** of the newly created WebLogic Server; as we have chosen a Public Subnet for the WLS network, both Compute instances that have been created have public IPs associated.  Use the Console URL provided in the **Outputs** section as shown above
- Login with **weblogic** username and the provided password

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image220.png)



- We can see that our domain has one admin server and two managed servers:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image230.png)



- We can check the Compute Instances to see what has been provisioned; From general hamburger menu choose *Core Infrastructure* -> *Compute* -> *Instances*:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image240.png)



- We can see two instances having our prefix mentioned during Stack configuration; one of them runs the admin server and a managed server and the other runs the second managed server:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image250.png)



- Congratulations! Your WLS domain is up&running! 



- We can check now if the out of the box deployed application is loading; From the Stack Job **Outputs**, open the **Sample Application URL**; it's loading, but we have to bypass the browser warning as we're using a Self Signed Certificate;
- Click **Advanced** button and **Proceed to ...** to continue:



![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image390.png)

- The out of the box deployed sample application is being served through a secured SSL Load Balancer Listener:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image400.png)



## Step 2. Deploy custom sample application

- Let's go back to the WebLogic Server admin console to deploy our sample web application:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image410.png)



- Go to *Domain Structure* menu, *Deployments*; **Lock & Edit** to switch to edit mode; Click **Install**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image420.png)



Follow **Upload your files** link and upload provided [SampleWebApp.war](resources/SampleWebApp.war) web archive file:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image430.png)



- Click **Next**, **Next**, leave *Install de deployment as an application* default option; click **Next**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image440.png)



- Choose deploying the application on WebLogic Cluster; click **Next**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image450.png)



- Leave default setting and click **Next**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image460.png)



- Choose *No, I will review the configuration later* and click **Finish**

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image470.png)



- **Activate Changes**:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image480.png)



- The application is now in *Prepared* state; switch to *Control* tab:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image490.png)



- Select the *SampleWebApp* web application and click **Start** -> **Serving all requests**; Click **Next** in the following screen:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image500.png)



- The *SampleWebApp* web application is in the *Active* State now:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image510.png)



- Now, test this new application at *https://< public load balancer IP >/SampleWebApp/*

 ![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image520.png)

- Click on the link to test this sample application:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image530.png)



- This is just another sample application, but you can deploy any other application; Congratulations!



## Step 3. Destroy resources

If you don't plan to use the WebLogic Domain anymore, to spare tenancy resources, the quickest way to delete the resources created during this lab is to run *Terraform Destroy*  on the Stack.

Navigate to *Solutions and Platform* > *Resource Manager* > *Stacks*, identify and click on the Stack name you have created at the beginning of this lab.

By running the *Destroy* action, a Terraform job will kick off and delete all created resources.

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image600.png)



When the job ends, you should see a similar log output:

![](images/wlscnonjrfwithenv/image610.png)



You can check that the Compute Instances and the Block Volumes have been terminated.

At the end you can also delete the Stack:
